Project Name: Yondu Udonta
Author: Zachary Peterson
Due Date: 01/20/2023
Course: CS1400-x01

Calculation of loot shares for each crew member under Yondu Udonta from data requested and input by the user.

This set of code shows the understanding of integer arithmetic, conditionals and use of variables
and their correlating values.

For this program to run, you need only run and supply integers as requested from the terminal.
Detailed errors will appear to point out any unusable entries.
