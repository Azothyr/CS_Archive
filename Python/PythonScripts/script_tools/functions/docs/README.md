# Functions Directory

## Overview

This directory contains standalone functions that perform specific tasks, useful for scenarios where the logic doesn't necessarily belong inside a class or handler.

## Best Practices

1. **Single Responsibility**: Functions should have a single, clear purpose.
2. **Documentation**: Describe the function's role, inputs, outputs, and side-effects in comments.
3. **Test Coverage**: Ensure corresponding tests exist in the `tests` directory.
