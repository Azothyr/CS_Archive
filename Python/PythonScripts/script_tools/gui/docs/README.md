# User Interface Scripts for Tools

This directory contains scripts responsible for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for various tools in the project.

## Structure

- `tool1_window.py`: Interface for `Tool1`.
- `tool2_window.py`: Interface for `Tool2`.
  
(Continue listing as per the actual scripts you'll have.)

## Usage

To run the interface for a specific tool:

```bash
python tool1_window.py
```

Replace `tool1_window.py` with the desired script name.

## Dependencies

Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed to run the GUI scripts. Typically:

- PyQt or PySide (if using Qt for Python GUIs)
- tkinter (if using the built-in Python GUI library)

(Adjust accordingly based on the actual libraries you're using.)
