# Utils Directory

## Overview

This directory holds utility functions and scripts that aid in various tasks, whether it's data transformation, string manipulations, or other helper tasks.

## Best Practices

1. **Generic Design**: Utils should be generic enough to be used across multiple parts of the application.
2. **Documentation**: Given the generic nature, clear documentation is essential to understand the purpose and usage of each utility function.
