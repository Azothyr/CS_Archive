# Config Directory

## Overview

This directory contains modules and classes dedicated to providing meta-information, configurations, or utilities that don't directly influence application logic but support its operations.

For instance, the `file_path_library` module has the `PathLib` class, which provides paths based on keys.

## Best Practices

1. **Clarity**: Ensure that names and purposes of classes or modules here are unambiguous.
2. **Documentation**: Comprehensive comments are vital, especially if the information or configuration is crucial for the application's operation.
