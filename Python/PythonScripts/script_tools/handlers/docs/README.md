# Handlers Directory

## Overview

This directory contains all handler functions responsible for processing incoming requests, data transformations, and interacting with other services or components. Handlers are a crucial aspect of the application's business logic.

## Structure

- Each handler should be named descriptively based on its functionality, e.g., `userRegistrationHandler.py` for handling user registrations.
- If a group of related handlers grows significantly, consider creating a sub-directory to group them together.

## Best Practices

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each handler should have a single responsibility. If a handler is doing too many things, it's a sign it might need to be split into multiple handlers.
2. **Error Handling**: Ensure robust error handling. Anticipate potential failures and provide meaningful error messages.
3. **Documentation**: Every handler should have a comment block at the beginning explaining its purpose, inputs, outputs, and any side effects.
4. **Consistency**: Stick to the established naming and structuring conventions for ease of readability and maintenance.

## Example

```python
# userRegistrationHandler.py

def register_user(data):
    """
    Registers a new user to the system.
    
    Parameters:
    - data (dict): Contains user registration details.
    
    Returns:
    - dict: Confirmation of registration.
    
    Side Effects:
    - Adds a new user to the database.
    """
