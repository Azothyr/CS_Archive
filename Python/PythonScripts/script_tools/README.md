# Script Tools

## Overview

The `script_tools` project houses a collection of scripts, components, utilities, and more, organized to facilitate and enhance various aspects of script development and management.

## Directory Structure

- **`components/`**: Houses reusable components. These components can be integrated across various parts of the application, providing specific functionalities or UI elements.
  
- **`functions/`**: Contains standalone functions that execute specific tasks. This is useful when a specific piece of logic doesn't necessarily belong inside a class or handler.
  
- **`handlers/`**: This directory consists of handler classes or functions that manage or orchestrate broader functionalities or flow of operations within the application.

- **`info/`**: Dedicated to providing meta-information, configurations, or utilities that don't directly influence application logic but support its operations. For example, the `file_path_library` module provides paths based on keys.

- **`tests/`**: Contains tests that validate the functionality and reliability of our application. This spans from unit tests to integration tests.

- **`utils/`**: Hosts utility functions and scripts aiding in tasks like data transformation, string manipulations, and other miscellaneous tasks that support main operations.

## Getting Started

1. **Setup**: Ensure all dependencies are installed. (You can list out steps or commands here if any.)

2. **Usage**: Dive into any directory to access its functionalities. Each sub-directory contains its specific README for more details.

3. **Testing**: Navigate to the `tests` directory and run the provided tests to validate functionalities.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Branching**: When adding a new feature or fixing a bug, always create a new branch.
2. **Naming Conventions**: Follow the established naming conventions for files, classes, and functions.
3. **Documentation**: Ensure all code is well-documented.
4. **Testing**: Write tests for any new feature or functionality added.
